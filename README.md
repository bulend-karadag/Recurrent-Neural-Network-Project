# Recurrent Neural Network Project
The idea is to predict the brazilian stock market (bovespa) daily level by using values of leading stock markets of the world and some other important daily indicator such as prices of gold, exchange rates some currencies with US Dollar, agricultural products etc.

## Packages
* Python
* tensorflow
* sklearn
* pandas

## Data
The data is mainly extracted from the site of Yahoo Finance, which is composed of daily values of stock markets and some other financial instruments. As the data of some of stock markets start off from the year of 2003, the time interval considered for the project is between 2003 and 2022.


The project is in its initial phase which still requires some tunning.
